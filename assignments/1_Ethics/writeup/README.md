This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

The first person I would tell about this security issue would be my supervisor/manager. Since it is my job to audit and find these security issues I have an obligation to acknowledge them no matter how long/how much money it will take to fix. Additionally, there should be company policies that I would have to make myself aware of that would tell me how to deal with these sort of issues and what responses I should be expecting on the part of my manager/s. The most ethical thing I can do is abide by company policy first (but this is also tied with federal law). If my direct supervisor is not listening and won't push back the release, I would probably try to go a step up (or 2) in the line of command to make sure that I am doing everything I can on my end to bring appropriate attention to the issue. I think that the most important thing I can do is go to each person individually and have a private conversation with them so that the issue stays professional but I'm also getting my point across. I would also make sure that there is some type of documentation that I went to each person so that I can back up what I did with evidence (maybe an email or minute or have a witness). I would personally make sure that I don't go to the public about the issue because that puts the company at risk for security hazards and I won't want to be the person to cause that. This could also get me into legal issues. Overall, I do believe that if I say nothing I am at fault for anything that happens because I knew about the security issue and it is not only my job but my moral duty to say something about it.
